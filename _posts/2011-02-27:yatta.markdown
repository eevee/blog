I am now, officially, as literate as a native Japanese two-year-old.  Almost.  Maybe.

I actually meant to condense all the grammar I know down to bullet points that make sense to me, and post it before I took the test.  I kinda never did that.  Oops!  Maybe some other time.

I haven't really studied in the past two months, either; time to get back into that.  I picked up a surprising number of phrases from watching FMA, so that's a good sign.
